                    <li>Meet your daily needs by consuming foods high in selenium.</li>
                    <li>The richest food sources of selenium are organ meats (calf's liver) and seafood, followed by muscle meats. Selenium is present in soil and therefore is most highly concentrated in plant-based foods grown in selenium-rich soil, including
                        fruits, vegetables and breads. The selenium content of food is highly variable because it depends so heavily on soil conditions. Highly regarded sources of selenium include a variety of mushrooms (in particular crimini and shiitake
                        mushrooms), and Brazil nuts.</li>
                    <li>Selenium can be toxic at high levels.</li>
                    <li>Consult healthcare practitioner if you consider taking selenium supplements.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Selenium (Se) is an essential trace mineral that plays important role in healthy functioning of reproductive and immune systems, and thyroid gland. Selenium is a powerful antioxidant, and it is a part of more than two dozen selenoproteins
                    that act in synergy with vitamin C, vitamin E and glutathione. Selenium deficiencies in general population are more frequent in the areas with low levels of selenium in the soil. In the US, selenium concentrations in the soil are higher
                    in Midwestern and Western States than in the South and Northeast. In the UK, according to several studies, many soils are deficient in selenium. Very low concentrations of selenium in some areas of China led to government-sponsored
                    supplementation program. Individuals with selenium imbalances are more susceptible to physiological responses to stress. Research suggests that optimal selenium intake contributes to lower risk of age-related chronic diseases, longevity,
                    and boosts fertility. Several genetic variations have been found to be associated with lower levels of selenium. Life-style factors that contribute to selenium imbalances include smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, stress, oral
                    contraception, and auto-immune conditions (such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, celiac disease).</p>

            <li>Meet your daily needs by consuming foods high in selenium.</li>
            <li>
              The richest food sources of selenium are organ meats (calf's
              liver) and seafood, followed by muscle meats. Selenium is present
              in soil and therefore is most highly concentrated in plant-based
              foods grown in selenium-rich soil, including fruits, vegetables
              and breads. The selenium content of food is highly variable
              because it depends so heavily on soil conditions. Highly regarded
              sources of selenium include a variety of mushrooms (in particular
              crimini and shiitake mushrooms), and Brazil nuts.

            <li>Selenium can be toxic at high levels.</li>
            <li>
              Consult healthcare practitioner if you consider taking selenium
              supplements.

            Our bodies use glucose as its main source of fuel. If glucose is not
            metabolized properly, it can bind to skin&rsquo;s collagen and
            elastin fibers forming abnormal cross-links. This leads to
            structural and functional tissue impairment which produces advanced
            glycation products (AGEs). This process, called glycation, is
            responsible in accelerated aging of the skin as it impairs
            skin&rsquo;s ability to regenerate and self-repair. Glycation has
            been described as caramelization (hardening) of the skin from the
            inside out. The skin-damaging effects of glycation cause wrinkles,
            dryness, skin laxity. Scientific research identified several genetic
            variations in NAT2, GLO1, and AGER genes are associated with
            excessive glycation. A recent study found that the presence of slow
            NAT2 acetylator types correlates with higher levels of AGEs in their
            skin. Genetic variations in the glyoxalase 1 enzyme (GLO1) that
            protects cells from AGEs can lower their activity which leads to the
            build-up of AGEs. Another gene implicated in glycation and skin
            aging is AGER receptor. Binding of AGEs to AGER results in
            activation of collagen breakdown enzymes and the pro-inflammatory
            cytokines. In simpler terms, it leads to the breakdown of collagen
            in the skin prompting wrinkles and other complexities.
